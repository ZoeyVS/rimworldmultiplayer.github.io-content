# Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: Where is Zetrith?

A: He disappeared in February of 2019. We haven't had contact from him since. We hope he's ok and doing well.

### Q: Is the mod dead?

A: No. There will be a formal announcement if the mod ever dies. No-progress does not mean the death of the mod. The mod is developed by the community, who all have lives outside of the mod. If you want something in the mod so badly, code it yourself! We review and merge any constructive PRs.

### Q: How can I contribute?

Check out our [Contributing Guidelines](https://github.com/rwmt/Multiplayer/blob/master/CONTRIBUTORS.md) and then check our documentation for more developer focused information on the mod. The best way to get in contact with fellow developers is on the #modders channel on our discord.

### Q: Where can I find documentation on the mod?

A: Detailed Documentation can be found on our [HackMD Wiki](https://hackmd.io/Gd_gueokTNui_fqzOSG2Tg?view#Dev-MP-Wiki).

### Q: How can players connect to each other?

A: Players can connect through Steam, LAN, or Direct. To use direct connect, portforward 30502 through UDP or use a software like Hamachi.

### Q: Is there PVP?

A: No. Currently everyone is playing in the same faction cooperatively.

### Q: Can mods be used in multiplayer?

A: Yes, but not all mods will work in multiplayer. We have many resources for determining which mods work with Multiplayer. The best way to find out which mods work is looking at our [spreadsheet](https://tinyurl.com/Multiplayer-Spreadsheet).

### Q: What do the numbers on the mod spreadsheet/website mean?

A: 0 is untested, 1 is not working, 2 is major issue, 3 is minor issues, and 4 is no issues and working fine.

### Q: What kind of mods are compatible?

A: Any mod coded in XML is automatically compatible with Rimworld Multiplayer. Mods coded in C# need to be manually
checked and will probably not work without compatibility patches.

### Q: What is a save replay?

A: A multiplayer save game.

### Q: How can I change my in-game name?

A: Your name can be changed under Options > Mod Settings > Multiplayer > Show Settings.

### Q: Can I play singleplayer with the mod enabled?

A: Yes, this should not cause any problems even with a lot of other mods enabled even if they are marked as incompatible.

### Q: Which RimWorld version should I be using?

A: Rimworld Multiplayer supports 1.0 and 1.1 with Royalty.

### Q: What is the maximum amount of players that can be in a game?

A: We recommend 8 players max, but there is no hardcoded limit.

### Q: Can I make a dedicated server?

A: No.

### Q: Why does simulating take so long?

A: Simulations takes place from the last autosave made, so if you do /autosave in chat before saving a replay or someone connects to your game it will speed up the simulation time. The same applies to resyncing, so if the host forces an autosave before someone resyncs it will also speed up their simulation time.

### Q: Is this mod fully vanilla compatible?

A: No, currently there are a few features that don't work in multiplayer. Faction renaming, and some caravan events are disabled. Since Royalty has a ton of quests, some of them might not have been checked and might desync. Report them in our
discord server if this happens.

### Q: How do I convert a Multiplayer game back to Singleplayer?

A: On the main menu click Multiplayer, select the save you want to convert and click watch. After watching it, select the time you want and click menu > convert to singleplayer. It should show up in your singleplayer folder after that.

### Q: How to clean a dirty core folder?

A: This can help you if you're having trouble loading Rimworld or in resolving Desync issues. Go to your Rimworld install folder > Mods > Core and delete the Core folder. Then, verify Rimworld's game files in Steam.

### Q: Can I donate?

We've closed donations for now. If you have money burning a hole in your pocket though, consider donating to NotFood. She's
