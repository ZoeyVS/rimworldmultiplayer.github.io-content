## How do I host a server?
[Server Hosting Tutorial on Youtube](https://youtu.be/tKuaS3CTFKo)

1. Create a singleplayer world, choose what colonists and landing place you want, and wait until your colonists get out of their pods.

2. Save the game, then press escape, and click the Host button on your menu.

3. Configure your desired settings on the Host window, and click host.

4. When hosting through Steam, users can just connect through your Steam friends list. With  the "direct" option, users shoudl portforward 30502 through UDP.

## Piracy Policy

We do not ban or restrict access to Rimworld Multiplayer if you have a pirated copy of the game, as it is too hard to differentiate between the DRM-free versions of Rimworld and the pirated ones. If you however reveal in anyway that you are using a pirated copy of the game, staff members will ignore any questions from you and call you out for it.
