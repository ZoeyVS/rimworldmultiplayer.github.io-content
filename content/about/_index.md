# What is Rimworld Multiplayer?

**Rimworld Multiplayer** is a community driven mod to implement Multiplayer into [Rimworld](https://rimworldgame.com/). The mod is unofficial, and in no way endorsed by Tynan or Ludeon Studios.

## Status

Currently, the project is in a "beta" state. We have many tasks ahead of us. On this website you will be able to find progress reports as long as we're kicking.

## Getting involved

We can always use extra hands. The entire project is open source and available on GitHub here:

* Main Repo: [rwmt/Multiplayer](https://github.com/rwmt/Multiplayer).

We primarily communicate through Discord, although there is an IRC channel that's connected to Discord with a bot.

* [Discord Invite](https://discord.gg/S4bxXpv)                                   

And have some general links to some related communities too:
