We have a sorta-functional website now. Much thanks to PJB, who patiently taught me a whole lot about web design in a very short amount of time.

## Why a website?

The website was created in order to have a better distribution platform than Discord for patch notes, download links, and general information about the project all coagulated in one place. Its also much better than Discord for sorting documentation and formatting pages.

Its not perfect, and a little barebones at the moment while I populate it with information, but it has the essentials.

If you have any suggestions or bug reports specific to the website, just @ me in the #suggestions channel on Discord, and i'll be happy to take a look.
